 * It sounds to me like you have to derive an XMLSigContext from the
 * XPathContext?
 *
 * > and supplied the Node which contains the xpath string as "owner". Question:

 *
 * Philosophically it's fine.  The owner is the TransformerImpl if XPath is
 * running under XSLT.  If it is not running under XSLT, it can be whatever
 * you want.
