The contents of this directory is created from prioritization-dt-lists/ and parallelization-dt-lists/.
For algorithms that are absolute or relative order, the list is copied from prioritiztion-dt-lists/
specific to that subject program, its test suite and its coverage.
For the original algorithm, the list is copied from parallelization-dt-lists/ specific to that
subject program and its test suite. More specifically, the k=16, original order file is copied
for each subject program and test suite. The same file is used for both statement and function
coverage.
