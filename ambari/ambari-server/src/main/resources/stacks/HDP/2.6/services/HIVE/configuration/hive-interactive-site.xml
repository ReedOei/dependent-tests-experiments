  Note: This file includes only those configs which are supposed to have different value from the parent hive/hive-site.
       It inherits the other required configs from hive/hive-site.
       The inheritance logic in order to get hive2/hive-site goes like this :

       1. We read the hive/hive-site which includes the stack defaults and Stack Advisor recommended values.
       2. We take the read hive/hive-site (step 1), and on top of it apply the hive-interactive-site to get
          hive2/hive-site.

       Therefore, any config defined here will override the config value read from hive2/hive-site (step 1).
